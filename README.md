## code review by  [Karl-Johan Lundholm](https://github.com/kallelundh)

- index.php: Try to keep the class names consistent. On line 43 you have camel case and on line 57 you have kebab case.
- style.css: Try to keep the whitespace consistent. From line 125 and down there is a lot of whitespace.
- data.php: Try to keep the grammatics correct in the comments. On line 31 and down there is a lot of misspellings. E.g: “sience”. (Also maybe change that in your arrays)
- index.php: Delete the extra opening and closing php tags on line 120-121.
- In the start of the page when responsive. At the top of the page there is a small margin with black space. Could be confused with being the entrance to hell?
