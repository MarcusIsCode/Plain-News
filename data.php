                                Glycans, which are found in the mucus are mainly responsible for this property. Researchers studied
                                the effects of glycans on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and discovered that this microbe no longer produced 
                                toxins or expressed genes, which are necessary for bacterial communication.This newly discovered
                                property might be useful in finding new ways to treat antibiotic
                                resistance in addition to traditional antibiotics.

                                 Researchers found that in presence of the antibiotic, bacteria, which are usually fast swimming, 
                                 develop sluggish behaviour and form aggregates. Further, bacteria that normally, aggregate in dense

                                 These batteries store sufficient energy from both solar and wind power making it possible
                                  to help our society to slowly move towards being fossil-fuel free.
                                  While Stanley Whittingham did the foundation work for these batteries in 1970, John Goodenough
                                   in 1980 increased its potential for changing the cathode used in the batteries. This spurred Akira 
                                   Yoshino to release the first commercially viable lithium-ion battery in
